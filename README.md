# Dataset for Paired Arabic Poetry and Melody

This repository offers a unique dataset of Arabic poetry, meticulously labeled with emotions, and melodies classified by their corresponding maqam names. This resource is invaluable for researchers exploring the intersection of emotion in poetry and traditional Arabic music.

### Whatâ€™s Inside:

- **Emotion-Based Categorization**: The dataset organizes poetry into three emotional categories, each paired with melodies from specific maqam classes:
  - **Sadness**: Characterized by *Maqam Saba* melodies.
  - **Love**: Paired with *Maqam Seka* melodies.
  - **Joy**: Accompanied by *Maqam Ajam* melodies.

### Abstract:

Recent advances in deep learning, particularly in generative adversarial networks (GANs), have paved the way for groundbreaking applications like photorealistic image generation, image translation, and automatic captioning. These advancements have unlocked new possibilities for cross-domain applications in computer-generated arts and literature. 

While there are software-based approaches for generating musical accompaniment for poetry, none leverage the power of GANs. This work introduces a novel approach to generating melodies conditioned on the emotional content of poetry using GANs. The dataset includes pairs of poetry and corresponding melodies based on three distinct emotional categories. 

Various GAN architectures, including SpecGAN and WaveGAN, were explored for automatic melody synthesis aligned with the emotion in the poetry. *Conditional SpecGAN* produced the best melodies according to quantitative metrics, and these melodies were also evaluated by volunteers, who rated their quality as above average.
